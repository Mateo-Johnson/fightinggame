# STEEL – Samurai Duel Fighter
## Combat
- **Attacks:** Low / Mid / High × Light / Heavy (6 total)

## Movement & Health
- Move left/right, with a dash and a short backstep.
- 1–2 hit kills.

## Arenas
- Single-screen, minimal obstacles, visually rich (dojo, bamboo forest, snowy cliff)  
- Optional hazards, moving scenery (maybe eventually)

## Enemies
- Primarily online multiplayer PVP focused but v1 has launched with just local PVP
